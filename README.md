# Smart Demand Forecasting Using Machine Learning
Demand forecasting is an essential aspect of strategic planning within the agrotech sector, where the fusion of agriculture and cutting-edge technologies fosters innovation and enhances operational efficiency. 
Precise forecasting enables agrotech companies to predict market demands, optimize production processes, manage inventory proficiently, and synchronize marketing strategies with anticipated demand. It is instrumental in refining decision-making processes and promoting sustainable growth. Nonetheless, forecasting in this domain presents significant challenges due to seasonal variations, sporadic and unreliable data, market instability, and external factors such as climatic conditions, governmental regulations, and evolving consumer preferences. These elements frequently hinder the creation of dependable predictive models. 
To address these obstacles, a range of forecasting techniques is utilized. These encompass conventional statistical methods like time series analysis and regression, alongside sophisticated data-driven approaches such as machine learning and hybrid models. Such tools facilitate the examination of historical trends and intricate variables to produce more precise and adaptable forecasts. 
In this project, the forecasting model was utilized for products that together accounted for 70% of the revenue in the last financial year. The model exhibited robust performance, with several key products attaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 2%, while many others reported MAPE figures below 5%. This reflects the modelâ€™s dependability across various significant demand scenarios. A limited number of products displayed greater forecast discrepancies (MAPE > 10%), indicating a requirement for additional refinement or more in-depth product-level analysis.
